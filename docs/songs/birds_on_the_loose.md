## Birds on the Loose

```
We had left our friend Lander behind,
but we did not have time to rewind.
After we had won the pirate battle,
slaughtering them just like cattle.
We found a locked chest full of treasure,
a pearl glowed with magic to our pleasure.
We continued on to Port Sarim with haste,
there simply was no time to waste.
The party split up at the market,
so many things for sale, even some carpet.
I was happy to fine myself a new flute,
although it would've been great to find a nice lute.
As we started to regroup I found Cato drooling,
some hatred inside of him was fueling.
He had to put his plan of freeing the birds on hold,
so as to talk with a powerful man; Hassan we'd been told.
I went off to sell our captured pirate boat,
as we wouldn't be able to keep it afloat.
After the sale we all met up at the bird shop,
to free the bird that caused Cato's heart to stop.
Morbius convinced a monkey the steal the keys,
able to hand them off to Butt with such ease.
Butt then tried his best to hide and wait,
unfortunately he barely fit behind the crate.
So we all returned back to the Dancing Mare,
ordering food and drink as we took a chair.
Most went to bed as I stayed up to perform,
drawing in the crowd with my perfect art form.
In the morning we rushed to catch our ride,
as the boat had to leave early for the tide.
We heard news of exotic birds on the loose,
the cuplrit most likely to get the noose.
