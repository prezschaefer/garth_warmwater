## Completing the Intro

```
It was now time to return to the Duke,
but make sure Sigmond did not spook.
Lander explained the whole situation,
spelling it out in perfect dictation.
Sigmond was then dismissed from the court,
kicked out on his butt from the fort.
The Duke and goblin soon found an agreement,
quickly coming to quite an appeasement.
I then requested assistance from the land,
as my home's danger was soon at-hand.
The party's work was now done,
it was finally time for some fun.
We returned back to the inn,
to celebrate our glorious win.
There was much dancing and drinking,
certainly no time for any kind of thinking.
In the morning we made our way down to the dock,
to find a ship probably about to sink like a rock.
Manhu and I found a place to lay down and rest,
we had stayed up all night, which was not the best.
A pack of giant mosquitos soon attacked us,
as the rest of the party turned them into puss.
Manhu and I attempted to return to our slumber,
as pirates attacked as we exited the river Lumber.
Morbius did fall and I was certainly next,
as Manhu continued to sleep and get a full rest.
Butt threw his hammer right off the side,
yet we defeated them; the party full of pride.
By now it was dusk and we had a decision to make,
we were to continue on, but which boat to take.
