## Our First


```
The Duke had made a declaration,
we accepted without a hesitation.
The hole was more than it seemed,
we were all unsure what that meaned.
The tunnels twisted and turned,
our torches gave us light as they burned.
Morbius asked, why don't you lead ahead,
the next thing I knew, he ended up dead.
Fell into a hole and swept down stream,
he was no longer part of our team.
A cleric arrived and took the lead,
around the next passage giant rats ready to feed.
I soothed the beasts and put them to sleep,
the others killed and piled them in a heap.
Yet we continued on, winding our way through,
to the left...to the right...in circles too.
Suddenly we found ourselves surrounded,
a series of grey blobs left us confounded.
As their touch was a danger to avoid,
what the acidic goop touched, it destroyed.
We out raced them and attacked from afar,
the whole encounter was certainly bizarre.
Then we found our way to a large room,
ominous, worrisome, and full of doom.
Two large gricks fell from the ceiling,
Cato was struck down, in need of healing.
Once...twice...he fell to the attack,
unable to get away and fall back.
We lead them into a narrow hall,
lucky for us they were not small.
They got stuck as they tried their best,
that was when I put them both to rest.
When they fell asleep we sealed them off,
we had defeated them, cough...cough.
And now our journey will continue on,
it's time to get going, so c'mon!
