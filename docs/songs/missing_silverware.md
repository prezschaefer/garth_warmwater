## Missing Silverware


```
We all returned to regroup at the inn,
we knew of the frame but not where to begin.
We had to find a way to show the deception,
to do so would require some high perception.
I would need to follow Greg to his meetup,
to get answers regardless of who got beatup.
But there I saw a familiar dark figure,
it was Sigmond, I did happen to figure.
I returned back to the inn to find Cato,
who stayed up perhaps to study some Plato.
Regardless, we went to wake up Butt,
to join and protect us no matter what.
Cato moved the stone around the doors,
as we crept quietly across the floors.
There, inside a backpack we did find,
it was the silverware for which we had pined.
We took it and sealed it within a rock,
to keep it safer than behind a simple lock.
When we returned to retreive the silverware,
we found a hobgoblin the size of a bear.
He and his friends meant to rob us,
and didn't expect much of a fuss.
I charmed him into thinking me an old friend,
so he tried to bring the fight to an end.
After I nearly died with an arrow to the heart,
Manhu caused them to retreat just after the start.
We brought the silverware back into town,
now we must find a way to bring Sigmond down.
