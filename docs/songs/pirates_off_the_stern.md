## Pirates off the Stern

```
Another day at sea without any rest,
I certainly was not feeling my best.
We learned the basics of how to sail,
we harnessed the wind of each gale.
Then, off in the distance Manhu did see,
a set of masts rised out of the sea.
Three pirates ships had been spotted,
our ship seemed to be their course plotted.
We manned the cannons as two gained on us,
causing the captain to yell and cuss.
We traded cannon shots at close range,
disabling one ship during the exchange.
The others attempted to board our ship,
as one fell after losing his grip.
A reef shark found a nice treat,
nibbling on his legs and feet.
As their captain climbed aboard,
we tried to hold of the pirate hoard.
We were being overwhelmed by their attacks,
skilled with their saber...or cutlass...or axe?
Morbius and Butt attacked from a distance,
as I was mortally wounded, requiring assistance.
Manhu tried to help from the crows nest,
but his crossbow aim wasn't the best.
Cato transformed into a giant beast,
a hyena, looking to feast.
Our party was able to finish the pirates off,
as their captain fell overboard with his head cutoff.
We continued to sail on our path,
the third ship checking on the aftermath.
We held off the pirates this time,
so now we had ourselves some downtime.
