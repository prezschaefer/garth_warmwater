## Orcs

1. Your teeth are so crooked, they give politians a run for their money
2. Your face is so ugly I thought it was a Picoso
3. Its good you have that sword so you can beat off the rats trying to fuck your face
4. Hey man, I thought I had it bad being short, but at least my face doesn't look like an asshole
5. You should probably pray to have god clear up that shit ass speech impedement you call a voice
6. It's a good thing it's so dark down here, I'd have killed myself if I were you and had seen such a fucked up body
7. Yeah, you're strong, but that won't lift you out of the grave after I'm done with you
8. Well, you proved me wrong, here I was thinking Goblins were the dumbest; thanks for correcting me by existing
9. What's that?! Oh yes, I can accomodate you by offering you a swift death; that should fix your fucked up life
10. Oh, that's your nose, I mistook it for a pigs tail; didn't realize it was that knarled and curly


## Goblins

1. Your green ass is uglier and hairier than the Philly Fanatic
2. Huh, it's almost like you wanted to hurt us, but obviously that can't be true, otherwise you would've hit us
3. Power in numbers only actually works when they add up to something; not basically equate to nothing
4. Incompetence must be contagious, it's the only thing that makes sense for the lot of to be this way
5. Man, I thought I'd seen some fucked up faces until now; and I'm pretty sure I've seen your mom
6. Oh I see, you're wearing a disguise...No?! Oh I'm sorry you just look like a piece of shit normally
7. You know what they say about goblins don't you?! Yeah, nothing, no one gives a shit about them
8. I'm so glad to see you all; I thought we were going to be in trouble, but looks like we caught a break
9. The power of the horde?! I think that only works when you have a horde, not this lousy bunch
10. I'm not sure what there's more of, your teeth, toes, eyes, or noses...I'd guess noses, but there aren't many of those either


## Beasts

1. Ahhh, cute, he wants to play does he?!
2. Nice, we finally found something to fight, maybe it'll put up a challenge even
3. What's it going to do, try to bite us with those dull teeth or something?
4. This one must be all hair and no brain by the looks of it. Grab a comb
5. Damn, smells like wet dog; Oh wait, I know what it is
6. I used to have a pet like you, but he was much more fun
7. Want to go for run do you?! Come on, let's go. Let's go!
8. Huh, that's odd, I would've thought an animal like you would be bigger
9. Those are some cute claws/talons/jaws you have there, it would be a shame if you were to lose them though
10. You know what you could use, a nice bath; maybe some curls; how about it?


## Giants

1. There isn't enough time in this world for you to understand this statement
2. Your pecker is as small as your brain; and used even less often
3. Just cause you're a giant doesn't mean you should be fat as shit...fat ass
4. You heard the one about the giant; probably not, it'd take too long to explain what a giant is to you
5. Ahh, the bigger their are, the fatter their ass is
6. Meh, being large is overrated. Now, being small, there's something worthy of attention
7. Well...well...well, what do we have here. Maybe I should get my eyes checked, I thought you all went extinct
8. Oh, you can understand us, I'm so surprised. I didn't think they made brains that large

4. You truely are beautiful, but you're just not my type
5. Your commune with nature is powerful, if only that could actually help you now
6. I'm familiar with your kind, you rely on tricks and deception; but perhaps you are only deceiving yourself

## Generic

1. Hahaha! Typical, only a <type> like you would believe you stand a chance against us
2. Give it up, you're as weak as you look
3. You may not have any brains, but I'd imagine you'd be smarter than to triffle with us
4. Go ahead, try to test us, just don't make dinner plans
5. I imagine you thought this would be easy, I hate to tell you, but you're wrong and are about to find out the hard way
6. Hey! Ugly!
7. I've read about your type, and all the sterotypes seem to fit. Too bad, I had higher hopes
8. You're smarter than this aren't you? Well obviously not if you're standing here
9. You like what you see?! I could offer you a bit more, if you're interested. You just might choke on it
10. I should be clear right up front, you're an asshole
11. Can you understand me? I bet not, but if you can, you certainly have impressed me
12. There's an old saying, if you look like ass, you certainly are one. Case in point
13. I used to believe that things happen for a reason. But your existence, just doesn't fit into that belief
14. You know, I could probably help you; but there isn't an infinite amount of time, so I don't see the point
15. Yeah, you're dumb
16. There is beauty in this world that is worth fighting for; then there's you, also worth fighting
17. Sometimes I wonder if we all can't just get along; but fuck you, now you die
18. I could intimidate you, but that's child's play. How about something more challenging, like falling in love with me
19. This is the end, not of us, but of you
20. Well, it's last call, better settle up; I'll make sure you get taken care of
