We requested an audience with the Duke,
to explain the hole was no fluke.
We returned to the inn for the night,
to find Morbius ready for another fight.
The next morning we returned to the cave,
passing the cook with a smile and wave.
Returning back where we had last ended,
all of our wounds and gear now mended.
We crept ahead deeper into the caves,
as we tried to solve the maze.
We came upon an underground goblin town,
secluding themselves as they dug down.
We returned to the Duke to broker peace,
with the goblin king's daughter, or was it his niece?
As we tried to discuss possible terms,
the Duke's counsel acted like they all had germs.
We then began to investigate the situation,
and then came to a revelation.
The counsel must have set up a frame,
to make the goblins take the blame.
In order to determine his malevolence,
we entered his room to find some evidence.
There we found a large locked chest,
to get into it would be some test.
Lander and Manhu questioned Greg and Gary,
their answers most certainly did vary.
Back to the inn we took the goblin daughter,
to prevent her from being in a slaughter.
This mystery we must unravel,
if we are to continue our travel.
